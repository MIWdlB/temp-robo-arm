# temp-robo-arm
Code to define and run commands on our robot arm

## What's in here?

Classes defining, joints, the pincer and the arm as a whole.

## ToDo

Facility to animate movements of the arm to test commands.

Possibly a structure to define movements in python and translate these to whatever the actuators need?
